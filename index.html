									<p>ParcelSwift Logistics is a courier and delivery company headquartered in Manchester, UK, with 740 employees. Over the past year, management has noticed an increase in employee absenteeism, particularly among frontline delivery staff. This has led to delayed deliveries, customer 
complaints, and rising overtime costs. The insights given were that, absenteeism is concentrated among experienced staff and specific demographics, affecting delivery consistency. Again, Monday-Tuesday spikes disrupt weekly planning and increase overtime costs, whiles lifestyle and seasonal factors suggest potential for targeted wellness programs.

									<p>Paytech, a technology company, is tracking the monthly performance of 
100 employees across 12 months in 2024. The HR and management 
team want to understand how employee performance changes over time 
and what factors drive high or low performance. They also want insights 
to make decisions on training, promotions, and workload balancing.
The Key Insights we gave were to reasses how promotions are awarded, and link promotions directly to consistent high performance, not just tenure or attendance. Also, audit training programs to ensure they address skill gaps that impact performance, not just compliance.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PureSip Beverages Analysis<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/nathalia-rosa-rWMIbqmOxrY-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>PureSip Beverages is a company specializing in the distribution of popular beverage brands like Coke, Fanta, and Sprite. They supply to major retail chains, including Costco, Walgreens, Target, and Walmart. PureSipBeverages relies on individual spreadsheets maintained by each regional manager to track sales. This siloed approach posed several challenges: Data Consolidation; Data Accuracy and  Limited Analysis.
										PureSip Beverages implemented Power BI to streamline their data management and gain valuable sales insights. Here's how local folder connections played a crucial role; we created a shared folder on a central server accessible to all retailers, each retailer uploads their sales spreadsheet to this folder at the end of each quarter. We also established a connection to the local folder. This connection automatically refreshes the data model whenever a new spreadsheet is uploaded, ensuring PureSip always has access to the latest sales information. The local folder connection eliminates the need for manual data consolidation, Power BI automatically integrates the data from all spreadsheets into a single, unified dataset.

										<h2><a href="#">Meddy Hospital Analysis<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/alexandr-podvalny-tE7_jvK-_YU-unsplash (1).jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Meddy Hospital is a mid-sized private healthcare provider with 500 employees. It is known for its patient-centred care and diverse workforce. Meddy Hospital operates 24/7 emergency, surgical, and outpatient services. Despite its solid reputation, the hospital is facing growing concerns around staff burnout, motivational challenges, and operational performance gaps. The overall performance score across the hospital is average, and patient wait times and satisfaction are beginning to reflect operational strain.
										We suggested the implement of rotating shifts, cross train staff, and bring in relief professionals to ease workload - especially in high pressure department like emergency and internal medicine. Again, provide access to employee assistance programs (EAPs), stress management workshops, and mental health days. High intent to leave among nurses and doctors signals poor perceived career progression. Therefore, a suggestion of creating clear promotion pathways, mentorship programs, and access to professional development.
